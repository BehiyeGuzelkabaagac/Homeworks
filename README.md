This repository contains various data analysis and machine learning assignments. Each assignment involves different datasets and analysis techniques.


## Homework 2

**File:** `homework2.py`

In this assignment, solutions to a specific problem were implemented using Python. The code is provided in a Python script format.

## Homework 3

**File:** `homework3.ipynb`

This assignment involves data analysis using Jupyter Notebook. The main steps include:

1. **Data Loading:** Required libraries and datasets were loaded.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The dataset was examined, and basic statistics were obtained.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Missing or incorrect values were identified and handled.
4. **Data Analysis:** In-depth analysis of the data was performed to extract key insights.
5. **Results:** Findings from the analysis were interpreted.

## Homework 4

**File:** `homework4.ipynb`

This assignment focuses on advanced data analysis and visualization techniques. The steps include:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** The `customers.csv` file was loaded using Pandas, and initial analysis was conducted.
2. **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to create visualizations.
3. **Modeling:** Machine learning models were built and evaluated.
4. **Results and Interpretations:** The model performance was analyzed and discussed.

## Homework 5

**File:** `homework5.ipynb`

This assignment analyzes Amazon product review data. The steps involved are:

1. **Data Loading:** The `amazon_review.csv` file was loaded using Pandas.
2. **Data Analysis:** The average product rating was calculated.
3. **Date Processing:** Review timestamps were converted to datetime format.
4. **Feature Engineering:** A new column was created to calculate the number of days since each review.
5. **Results:** Key insights were extracted and discussed.
